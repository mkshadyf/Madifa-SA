Video Streaming Platform Master Plan
=====================================

Document Purpose
----------------
This master plan is the comprehensive blueprint for building a web-based video streaming platform MVP. It ensures that all involved parties—project manager, developers, and tools (Replit, Cursor, Windsurf)—understand their roles, responsibilities, and how to collaborate effectively. Transparency, communication, and alignment with the CEO’s interests are embedded throughout to deliver a high-quality product quickly and cost-effectively. All instructions and prompts originate from Grok, your AI assistant created by xAI, to provide clarity and accountability.

1. Project Overview and Goals
-----------------------------
Objective:
Develop a web-based video streaming platform that allows users to subscribe for premium content and monetizes free content through ads. The initial focus is a functional MVP with plans for future scalability (e.g., mobile app support via Progressive Web App).

CEO’s Interests:
- Rapid delivery of a functional MVP.
- Cost efficiency using free or low-cost tools.
- Scalability to support future growth.
- Revenue generation via subscriptions and ad monetization.
- Transparent communication and coordination throughout development.

How We Align:
- Leverage free tiers of Firebase (hosting, auth, database) and Vimeo/Dailymotion (video hosting).
- Use PayFast (no setup fees) for subscriptions instead of Stripe.
- Employ AI tools (Cursor, Windsurf) to accelerate development.
- Deliver a web-first MVP with PWA capabilities for mobile access.

- Tools: "Support communication by ensuring real-time updates (Replit) and code consistency (Cursor, Windsurf)." (Source: Grok)

Transparency Commitment: All updates, decisions, and issues will be documented and accessible to keep everyone aligned with the CEO’s interests.

4. Development Phases
---------------------
Phase 1: Planning
Duration: 1 week
Tasks: Define requirements, create timeline, assign responsibilities.

- Project Manager: "Draft a timeline with milestones (e.g., coding start, testing, deployment). Assign tasks based on developer strengths." (Source: Grok)
- Developers: "Review requirements (e.g., subscription flow, ad integration) and estimate task durations." (Source: Grok)
- Replit: "Set up a workspace for brainstorming requirements and UI mockups under project manager guidance." (Source: Grok)
- Cursor: "Prepare to assist with initial code structure suggestions." (Source: Grok)
- Windsurf: "Stand by to generate planning-related boilerplate (e.g., project config files)." (Source: Grok)

Phase 2: Coding
Duration: 3 weeks
Tasks: Build frontend, backend, and integrations.
